Once we have a neural network, the next question is how to train it. Well maybe not so straightforward. Often model building and training is an iterative process, and what we can train directly determines what we will build. 

To train a network we'd also need a loss function, which measures how well the network performs. Since model performance can be measured in different ways, for different purpose we might need different loss functions. But since many networks are building using various probability distributions, the most common one will be -logp, the negative log data likelihood.

And although Stochastic Gradient Descent (and its variants and derivatives) are the most common method to train a network, it's actually not the only one. For example the optimization method might not be stochastic (using the whole dataset at once), or it might not be gradient based, but SGD is the most common one. For SGD to work we of course need the gradient, and to have gradient we'd need the loss function to be differentiable, and this necessitates some structural constraints on the network we are building, and the loss function we are using.

## Gradient descent optimisation 

simply put, gradient descent initialize the weights somewhere, calculate
an increment using gradient information, and modify the weights using
this information.

$$
\mathbf{w}^{(\tau)} = \mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)} + \Delta \mathbf{w}^{(\tau-1)} 
$$

the bulk of our attention will be devoted to how to get the gradient,
but the starting point is also quite important.
