The simplest machine learning models assume that the observed data
values are **unstructured**, meaning that the elements of the data
vectors x are treated as if we do not know anything in advance about how
the individual elements might relate to each other. If we were to make a
random permutation of the ordering of these variables and apply this
fixed permutation consistently on all training and test data, there
would be no difference in the performance for the models considered so
far.

Many applications of machine learning, however, involve structured data
in which there are additional relationships between input variables. For
example, the words in natural language form a sequence, and if we were
to model language as a generative autoregressive process then we would
expect each word to depend more strongly on the immediately preceding
words and less so on words much earlier in the sequence. Likewise, the
pixels of an image have a well-defined spatial relationship to each
other in which the input variables are arranged in a two-dimensional
grid, and nearby pixels have highly correlated values.

We have already seen that our knowledge of the structure of specific
data modalities can be utilized through the addition of a regularization
term to the error function in the training objective, through data
augmentation, or through modifications to the model architecture. These
approaches can help guide the model to respect certain properties such
as invariance ([9.1.3](id:d1e008fe-d25a-4f8d-9b3d-4abc452d9d21)) and
equivariance ([9.1.4](id:f741dfcc-7759-43b6-9438-db25197f77b3)) with
respect to transformations of the input data. In this chapter we will
take a look at an architectural approach called a convolutional neural
network (CNN), which we will see can be viewed as a sparsely connected
multilayer network with parameter sharing, and designed to encode
invariances and equivariances specific to image data.
