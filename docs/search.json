    "text": "Preface\nThis project is a WIP.\nI’m a great fan of Bishop’s 2006 book, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML), so as an AI practioner coming from a Bayesian background, I’m quite happy to learn that Bishop (and Bishop) have published a new book dedicated to deep learning and artificial intelligence. The focus on generative models is especially enticing, firstly because it is all the rage for the moment; secondly for a Bayesian statistician, doing generative modeling has always been what we are trained for.\nThe book has 20 chapters, I have divided them roughly into three parts.\n\nFoundations: chapters 1-5, covers the basics of machine learning.\nDeep Learning: chapters 6-13, covers the nuts and bolts of deep learning.\nGenerative Models: chapters 14-20, covers generative modeling and some common model architectures.\n\nHerein collected are my notes of the book, and the code to implement some concepts from the book. Since these are my understanding of the book, they might not be completely accurate, so do refer to the book for the most accurate description. And let me know if you find any errors!\nThe notes and code are written in a literate programming style (See Knuth (1984) for additional discussion). The references are not complete; I only included the ones I have reviewed myself.\n\n\n\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming.” Comput.

    "title": "18  Normalizing Flows",
    "section": "",
    "text": "18.1 Coupling flows\nRecall that in flow models we aim for the following goals:\nEach flow model will attempt to meet these goals in different ways. In coupling flows, for each layer of the network, we first split the latent variable \\(\\mathbf{z}\\) into two parts \\(\\mathbf{z} = (\\mathbf{z}_A, \\mathbf{z}_B)\\), then apply the following transformation:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{X}_A &= \\mathbf{Z}_A, \\\\\n\\mathbf{X}_B &= \\exp(s(\\mathbf{Z}_A, w)) \\odot \\mathbf{Z}_B + b(\\mathbf{Z}_A, w).\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe frist part \\(\\mathbf{X}_A\\) is simply left unchanged, and all the efforts are put into transforming the second part \\(\\mathbf{X}_B\\). The transformation is done by a neural network with parameters \\(w\\), which takes \\(\\mathbf{Z}_A\\) as input and outputs two vectors \\(s(\\mathbf{Z}_A, w)\\) and \\(b(\\mathbf{Z}_A, w)\\) of the same dimensionality as \\(\\mathbf{Z}_B\\). Besides, an \\(\\exp\\) function is used to ensure that the Jacobian determinant is easy to compute.\nNow let’s check how this formula meets the three aformentioned goals. First is invertability. Simply rearrange the terms and we can get the inverse transformation:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{Z}_A &= \\mathbf{X}_A, \\\\\n\\mathbf{Z}_B &= (\\mathbf{X}_B - b(\\mathbf{X}_A, w)) \\odot \\exp(-s(\\mathbf{X}_A, w)).\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNotice how the inverse transformation does not involve inverting the neural networks at all, just changing the sign of the \\(\\exp\\) function. This is the key to making the transformation invertible easy and efficient.\nSecond is computing the Jacobian determinant. It turns out the Jacobian is a lower trianglular matrix\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathbf{I} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{Z}_B}{\\partial \\mathbf{X}_A} & \\text{diag}(-\\exp(s(\\mathbf{Z}_A, w)))\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nand the determinant is simply the product of the diagonal elements.\nTo make the network more expressive, normalizing flows often have multiple coupling layers stacked together, switching the roles of \\(\\mathbf{Z}_A\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Z}_B\\) at each layer, and possibly also changing the split points at each layer. The final data likelihood is the product of the likelihoods at each layer. And the Jacobian determinant is the product of the determinants at each layer.\nThird is sampling. Once the model is trained, we can start with \\(\\mathbf{Z}_A\\), and follow the flow till we get to \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). The sampling process is deterministic and easy to compute.\nAs an example we can train a normalizing flow model on a two-moons dataset, using the normflows package. The following code is adapted from the package’s example code.\n# Import required packages\nimport torch\nimport numpy as np\nimport normflows as nf\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\ndevice = 'cuda'\nThis is the target distribution\n# Define target distribution\ntarget = nf.distributions.TwoMoons()\n# Plot target distribution\ngrid_size = 200\nxx, yy = torch.meshgrid(torch.linspace(-3, 3, grid_size), torch.linspace(-3, 3, grid_size), indexing='xy')\nzz = torch.cat([xx.unsqueeze(2), yy.unsqueeze(2)], 2).view(-1, 2)\nzz = zz.to(device)\n\nlog_prob = target.log_prob(zz).to('cpu').view(*xx.shape)\nprob = torch.exp(log_prob)\nprob[torch.isnan(prob)] = 0\n\nplt.pcolormesh(xx, yy, prob.data.numpy(), cmap='hot')\nplt.gca().set_aspect('equal', 'box')\nConstruct the model. To define a normalizing flow model, we first specify the base distribution and the transformation layers, and then combine them in the NormalizingFlow class.\n# Define 2D Gaussian base distribution\nbase = nf.distributions.base.DiagGaussian(2)\n\n# Define list of flows\nnum_layers = 2\nflows = []\nfor i in range(num_layers):\n    # Neural network with two hidden layers having 64 units each\n    # Last layer is initialized by zeros making training more stable\n    param_map = nf.nets.MLP([1, 64, 64, 2], init_zeros=True)\n    # Add flow layer\n    flows.append(nf.flows.AffineCouplingBlock(param_map))\n    # Swap dimensions\n    flows.append(nf.flows.Permute(2, mode='swap'))\n\nmodel = nf.NormalizingFlow(base, flows)\nmodel = model.to(device)\nTrain the model.\nmax_iter = 3201\nnum_samples = 2 ** 9\nshow_iter = 800\n\nloss_hist = np.array([])\nprob_list = []\noptimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=5e-4, weight_decay=1e-5)\n\nfor it in tqdm(range(max_iter)):\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n\n    #

Here we introduce a well known mathematical concept, the differential equation, into the neural network, and thus satisfying both the invertibility and the constant dimensionality requirements.\n\n18.4.1 Neural differential equation\nNeural differential equation, as the name implies, is a neural network that is defined by a differential equation. We can consider the residual network as a discrete version of the differential equation, since the “residual” is already a difference between consecutive layers, and the differential is the limit of this difference as it approaches zero. Thus starting from a residual network\n\\[\n\\mathbf{z}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{z}_t + f(\\mathbf{z}_t, \\mathbf{w})\n\\]\nwe can readily convert it into a differential equation\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{z(t)}}{dt} = f(\\mathbf{z(t)}, \\mathbf{w}).\n\\]\nNow defining something is easy, what really matters is what we can do with it.

The first term is two distributions of the same variable, so we are again dealing with a KL divergence term.\nUsing this, we can rewrite the ELBO as 20.31\nNow the ELBO consist of two terms, which we call the reconstruction term and the consistency term.\nThe reconstruction term is the logp weighted by z1, and thus measures how much we can reconstruct the data once the latent variable distribution is know. The consistency term is the KL divergence between the forward diffusion distribution and the reverse decoder network. So now we are finally able to connect what we need to compute, the (approximate) data likelihood, to what we have actually defined, the forward diffusion process and the backward denoising neural network. And we can happily proceed with the parameter optimization that we are so fond of.\nSince the two distributions in the KL divergence are both Gaussian, the divergence can be easily computed. 20.33\n\n\n20.2.4 predicting the noise\nwe are already able to optimize the model parameters, by matching the reverse denoising network to the forward diffusion network, by representing the KL devergence as the squared difference between the means of the forward and reverse process.\nit turns out we can use a simply trick, not modeling the mean of the reverse process, but the noise added to the latent variable, to improve the training and the generated image quality.\nit also turns out that when using this formulation, the reconstruction term can be viewd as a special case of the consistency term and merged together. So now we are left with a simple training procedure as follows:\n\n\n\n20.2.5 generating new samples",

    "section": "20.3 Score matching",
    "text": "20.3 Score matching\nThe denoising diffusion models discussed so far in this chapter are closely related to another class of deep generative models that were developed relatively independently and which are based on score matching. These make use of the score function or Stein score, which is defined as the gradient of the log likelihood with respect to the data vector\nHere it is important to emphasize that the gradient is with respect to the data vector, not with respect to any parameter vector. Since the score function is the gradient wrt the input data\n\nit is vector-valued, and has the same dimensionality as the input.\nintegrating the score function over the data space gives the log data likelihood, up to a constant.\n\nSo if we parameterize the score function as s(x, w), optimize the parameters w so that the parameterized score matches the empirical data score, we have effectively modeled the data distribution. And if we can further generate samples using the parameterized score function, we have built a generative model of the data that we can sample from.\nFigure 20.5 shows an example of a probability density in two dimensions, along with the corresponding score function.\nTo use score matching, we need to define two models\n\ndefine a model for the data, calculate the logp and the score function\ndefine a second model for the score, optimizing the parameters by\nmatching the data score function do sampling using the parameterized score model\n\n \n\n20.3.1 score loss function\nthe training match the model score to the data distribution score.\n\\[\nJ(\\mathbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int \\left\\| \\mathbf{s}(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{w}) - \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} \\ln p(\\mathbf{x}) \\right\\|^2 p(\\mathbf{x}) \\, d\\mathbf{x}\n\\]\nof course this is only theoretically; we don’t actually know the data distribution. we now move on to workarounds.\n\n\n20.3.2 modified score loss\nwe first approximate the data distribution with the empirical one \\[\np_{\\mathcal{D}}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\delta(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}_n)\n\\]\nsince the empirical distribution is not differentiable, we then smooth it with the Parzen estimator \\[\nq_{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{z}) = \\int q(\\mathbf{z} | \\mathbf{x}, \\sigma)p(\\mathbf{x}) \\, d\\mathbf{x}\n\\]\nthis results in the loss function \\[\nJ(\\mathbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{2N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\int \\left\\| \\mathbf{s}(\\mathbf{z}, \\mathbf{w}) - \\nabla_{\\mathbf{z}} \\ln q(\\mathbf{z}|\\mathbf{x}_n, \\sigma) \\right\\|^2 q(\\mathbf{z}|\\mathbf{x}_n, \\sigma) \\, d\\mathbf{z} + \\text{const.}\n\\]\nin the end, note we are matching scores of the latents, not the data.\n\n\n20.3.3 noise variance\n\n\n20.3.4 stochastic differential equations\nthe forward process as a SDE\n\\[\ndz = f(\\mathbf{z}, t) \\, dt + g(t) \\, d\\mathbf{v}\n\\]\nwith drift and diffusion terms, respectively, where the drift term is deterministic, as in an ODE, but the diffusion term is stochastic, for example given by infinitesimal Gaussian steps. We use the schotastic process to add noise to data.\nuse the reverse time stochastic process to remove the noise.\n\\[\ndz = \\left\\{ f(\\mathbf{z}, t) - g^2(t) \\nabla_{\\mathbf{z}} \\ln p(\\mathbf{z}) \\right\\} dt + g(t) \\, d\\mathbf{v}\n\\]\nwhere we recognize \\(\\nabla_{\\mathbf{z}} \\ln p(\\mathbf{z})\\) as the score function. The SDE given by (20.55) is to be solved in reverse from \\(t = T\\) to \\(t = 0\\).\nTo actually solve the SDE numerically, we need to discretize the time variable. The simplest approach is to use fixed, equally spaced time steps, which is known as the Euler–Maruyama solver. For the reverse SDE, we then recover a form of the Langevin equation. However, more sophisticated solvers can be employed that use more flexible forms of discretization.\nFor all diffusion processes governed by an SDE, there exists a corresponding deterministic process described by an ODE whose trajectories have the same marginal probability densities \\(p(\\mathbf{z}|t)\\) as the SDE.\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{z}}{dt} = f(\\mathbf{z}, t) - \\frac{1}{2} g^2(t) \\nabla_{\\mathbf{z}} \\ln p(\\mathbf{z}).\n\\]\nThe ODE formulation allows the use of efficient adaptive-step solvers to reduce the number of function evaluations dramatically. Moreover, it allows probabilistic diffusion models to be related to normalizing flow models, from which the change-of-variables formula (18.1) can be used to provide an exact evaluation of the log likelihood.",

During optimization of the error function through gradient descent, the training error typically decreases as the model parameters are updated, whereas the error for hold-out data may be non-monotonic. This behaviour can be visualized using learning curves, which plot performance measures such as training set and validation set error as a function of iteration number during an iterative learning process such as stochastic gradient descent. These curves provide insight into the progress of training and also offer a practical methodology for controlling the effective model complexity.\n\n9.3.1 Early stopping\n\n\n9.3.2 Double descent\nDouble descent entends the bias-variance trade-off to the big-data/large-model regime where we have so much data that we can fit a model of any size to it.\n\nIn the classical regime, we have limited data, thus we seek a bias-variance balance. In the modern regime, since we have so much data, increasing the model size always leads to better test results.\nThe black dashed line marks the interpolation threshold, where the model’s capacity is just enough to perfectly fit the training data.\n\nstochastic gradient descent not only makes the training more feasible, but also makes the model more robust.",

    "text": "12.1 Attention\nattention was originally developed as an enhancement to RNNs for machine translation, however Vaswani et al. (2017) later showed that \"attention is all you need\", i.e. significantly improved performance could be obtained by eliminating the recurrence structure and instead focusing exclusively on the attention mechanism. Today, transformers based on attention have completely superseded RNNs in almost all applications.\nWe will motivate the use of attention using natural language as an example, although it has much broader applicability. Consider the word \"bank\" in the following sentence: I swam across the river to get to the other bank.\nthe word ‘bank’ can mean different things, However, this can be detected only by looking at the context provided by other words in the sequence. We also see that some words are more important than others in determining the interpretation of ‘bank’. We see that to determine the appropriate interpretation of ‘bank’, a neural network processing such a sentence should attend to specific words from the rest of the sequence.\nMoreover, we also see that the particular locations that should receive more attention depend on the input sequence itself: in the first sentence it is the second and fifth words that are important whereas in the second sentence it is the eighth word. In a standard neural network, different inputs will influence the output to different extents according to the values of the weights that multiply those inputs. Once the network is trained, however, those weights, and their associated inputs, are fixed. By contrast, attention uses weighting factors whose values depend on the specific input data. Figure 12.2 shows the attention weights from a section of a transformer network trained on natural language.\nFigure 12.2 An example of learned attention weights. [From Vaswani et al. (2017) with permission.] The law will never be perfect, but its application should be just, this is what we are missing, in my opinion.\nIn natural language processing (NLP) we need to embed words into vectors, and these vectors can then be used as inputs for subsequent neural network processing. These embeddings capture elementary semantic properties, for example by mapping words with similar meanings to nearby locations in the embedding space. However such embeddings are one-to-one and deterministic, a given word always maps to the same embedding vector. A transformer can be viewed as a richer form of embedding in which a given vector is mapped to a location that depends on the other vectors in the sequence. Thus, the vector representing ‘bank’ in our example above could map to different places in a new embedding space for the two different sentences. For example, in the first sentence the transformed representation might put ‘bank’ close to ‘water’ in the embedding space, whereas in the second sentence the transformed representation might put it close to ‘money’.",

    "text": "12.2 Natural language\nNow that we have studied the architecture of the transformer, we will explore how this can be used to process language data consisting of words, sentences, and paragraphs. Although this is the modality that transformers were originally developed to operate on, they have proved to be a very general class of models and have become the state-of-the-art for most input data types. Later in this chapter we will look at their use in other domains.\nMany languages, including English, comprise a series of words separated by white space, along with punctuation symbols, and therefore represent an example of sequential data. For the moment we will focus on the words, and we will return to punctuation later.\nThe first challenge is to convert the words into a numerical representation that is suitable for use as the input to a deep neural network. One simple approach is to define a fixed dictionary of words and then introduce vectors of length equal to the size of the dictionary along with a ‘one hot’ representation for each word, in which the kth word in the dictionary is encoded with a vector having a 1 in position k and 0 in all other positions.\nAn obvious problem with a one-hot representation is that a realistic dictionary might have several hundred thousand entries leading to vectors of very high dimensionality. Also, it does not capture any similarities or relationships that might exist between words. Both issues can be addressed by mapping the words into a lower-dimensional space through a process called word embedding in which each word is represented as a dense vector in a space of typically a few hundred dimensions.\n\n12.2.1 Word embedding\nCBOW (continuous bag of words) and skip-gram approach for word embedding\n \n\n\n12.2.2 Tokenisation\n\nSentencePiece\nKarpathy’s tutorial on YT\n\n\n12.2.3 Bag of words\n\n\n12.2.4 Autoregressive models\n\n\n12.2.5 Recurrent neural networks\n \n\n\n12.2.6 Backpropagation through time",

    "text": "12.3 Transformer language models\nThe transformer processing layer is a highly flexible component for building powerful neural network models with broad applicability. In this section we explore the application of transformers to natural language. This has given rise to the development of massive neural networks known as large language models (LLMs), which have proven to be exceptionally capable (Zhao et al., 2023).\nTransformers can be applied to many different kinds of language processing task, and can be grouped into three categories according to the form of the input and output data. In a problem such as sentiment analysis, we take a sequence of words as input and provide a single variable representing the sentiment of the text, for example happy or sad, as output. Here a transformer is acting as an encoder of the sequence. Other problems might take a single vector as input and generate a word sequence as output, for example if we wish to generate a text caption given an input image. In such cases the transformer functions as a decoder, generating a sequence as output. Finally, in sequence-to-sequence processing tasks, both the input and the output comprise a sequence of words, for example if our goal is to translate from one language to another. In this case, transformers are used in both encoder and decoder roles. We discuss each of these classes of language model in turn, using illustrative examples of model architectures.\n\n12.3.1 Decoder transformers\n \n\n\n12.3.2 Sampling strategies\n\n\n\n12.3.3 Encoder transformers\n\n\n\n12.3.4 Seq2seq transformers\n \n\n\n12.3.5 Large language models",

    "text": "12.4 Multimodal transformers\nAlthough transformers were initially developed as an alternative to recurrent networks for processing sequential language data, they have become prevalent in nearly all areas of deep learning. They have proved to be general-purpose models, as they make very few assumptions about the input data, in contrast, for example, to convolutional networks, which make strong assumptions about equivariances and locality. Due to their generality, transformers have become the state-of-the-art for many different modalities, including text, image, video, point cloud, and audio data, and have been used for both discriminative and generative applications within each of these domains. The core architecture of the transformer layer has remained relatively constant, both over time and across applications. Therefore, the key innovations that enabled the use of transformers in areas other than natural language have largely focused on the representation and encoding of the inputs and outputs.\nOne big advantage of a single architecture that is capable of processing many different kinds of data is that it makes multimodal computation relatively straightforward. In this context, multimodal refers to applications that combine two or more different types of data, either in the inputs or outputs or both. For example, we may wish to generate an image from a text prompt or design a robot that can combine information from multiple sensors such as cameras, radar, and microphones. The important thing to note is that if we can tokenize the inputs and decode the output tokens, then it is likely that we can use a transformer.\nFor the input, as long as we can encode and align the inputs from different modalities, we can simply dump them all to the transformer. However, if the output is multimodal, we need to specify which output nodes correspond to which output.\n\n12.4.1 Vision transformers\nIllustration of the vision transformer architecture for a classification task.

This matrix plays a critical role in the operations of GNNs, particularly in defining graph convolution operations.\nPermutation Equivariance is a desirable property in graph neural networks, ensuring that the output of the GNN does not change when the nodes of the input graph are reordered.
